## Why PDFSlim?

Windows 7 and 8 lack any built-in PDF editing tools. Even on Windows 10+, the default **Edge PDF viewer only supports basic annotations**—no cropping, text edits, or high-level modifications without third‑party or paid software :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

PDFSlim fills this gap by providing:

- Browser-free, offline editing  
- A simple, intuitive UI  
- All key features—highlighting, cropping, saving—for free
